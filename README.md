# Song genre predictor based on Spotify data

This repo contains the code developed for the Data Mining I project. The contents of the repo are the following:
* [data](data/) &rarr; folder containing the [Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset)
* [data-exploration.ipynb](data-exploration.ipynb) &rarr;  notebook to visualize the features of the dataset and propose preprocessing steps
* [decision-tree.ipynb](decision-tree.ipynb) &rarr; intial classification attempt using a Decision Tree

Feel free to add your own ideas and notebooks :) 

Models which we intend to explore (Pick one or two and write your name behind it): 
- Logistic Regression -
- Naive Bayes - Artem
- Decision Tree - Miguel
- Random Forest - Julian
- XGBoost - Nico
- Support Vector Machine - 
- KNN (classifier) - Liza

## Additional ideas 
- Scrape Web data for song lyrics to generate features via basic NLP techniques
- Include additional datasets that may include performance enhancing features
- Use semi-supervised learning techniques (as clustering would make sense, even though the data is labeled(e.g. feature generation))
- Maybe craft an own evaluation measure which perfectly fits the task
