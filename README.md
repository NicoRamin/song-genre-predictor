Feel free to add your own ideas and notebooks :) 

My additional ideas would be: 
- Scrape Web data for song lyrics to generate features via basic NLP techniques
- Include additional datasets that may include performance enhancing features
- Use semi-supervised learning techniques (as clustering would make sense, even though the data is labeled(e.g. feature generation))
- Maybe craft an own evaluation measure which perfectly fits the task
